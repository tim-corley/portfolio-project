Responsible for the full range of testing (automated & manual) on the "SiteWorx" internet-of-things cloud application (web & mobile). As new features are rolled-out (backend & frontend), I coordinate with product managers and developers to outline acceptance criteria, document & organize test cases in our TestRail suite, execute manual, exploratory testing on development builds/branches, and develop automated UI tests with scripts written in Python and run with Selenium/Appium. In addition to the SiteWorx cloud applications, I test the in-house built commisioning software used by application engineers out in the field to configure and calibrate ligting fixtures/systems.
