Designed, documented, and executed a wide range of manual testing plans including acceptance, regression, smoke, and ad-hoc tests for the Android Mobile Application development team. Lead efforts to push testing further "left" (i.e. earlier) in the development and deployment cycles by building out end-to-end test automation. Leveraged the Espresso testing framework along with the JUnit test runner to develop and run automated UI tests for all critical components / flows within the Android mobile app. Worked with the DevOps team to get these tests incorporated into the team's Continous Integration system. Ultimately, these efforts boosted confidenct by increasing overall test coverage and enabled agility by driving down time between releases.
